# DIYMakeyGo
Inspired by [DesignitMakeyGo](https://github.com/murilopolese/DesignitMakeyGo).

## Requirements
Install the latest version of the [Quirbot Arduino library](https://github.com/Quirkbot/QuirkbotArduinoLibrary/releases).

Due to how the Quirkbot library handles the HID devides, you **must** use at least **Arduino 1.6.6**. At the time of this writing, you can only get that as a *hourly build*. [Download it here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

## Usage

Open ``DIYMakeyGo.ino`` in Arduino and upload the code to an *Arduino Pro Micro*. Hopefully the code will be self-explanatory.

## Thanks <3

[Murilo Polese](https://github.com/murilopolese) for the initial idea and first version of the sketch.

Some random internet person for this [super simple implementation of a capacitive sensor](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/CapacitiveSensor). That function is basically the heart of it all.
