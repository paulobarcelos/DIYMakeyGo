# DIYMakeyGo
Inspired by [DesignitMakeyGo](https://github.com/murilopolese/DesignitMakeyGo).

## Requirements
Install the latest version of the [Quirbot Arduino library](https://github.com/Quirkbot/QuirkbotArduinoLibrary/releases).

Due to how the Quirkbot library handles the HID devides, you **must** use at least **Arduino 1.6.6**. At the time of this writing, you can only get that as an *hourly built*. [Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

## Usage

Open ``DIYMakeyGo.ino`` in Arduino and upload the code to an *Arduino Pro Micro*.
